To run the code:

Clone the repo: git clone
Run the code: cargo run

The code will not compile, we spent so much time fixing bugs but others keep popping up. We narrowed it down to ownership and borrowing errors but ran out of time.
Other than that we checked the logic and should work after fixing those errors.
