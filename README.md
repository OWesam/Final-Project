# Final-Project

Group Name: Project Snake

Group Members: Wesam Oueslati(woues2), Ayush Tarachandani(ayusht3)

Project: 
  We want to build a neural network capable of performing as well as an average player or even better in the game snake. We will be building a neural network and training it on a pre-made game of snake. Our goal is to make this network figure out the best and most efficient way to play the game for the longest time.

Technical overview:
  We plan on spending most of the time learning about neural networks and how to build one. We then plan on looking through example neural networks in rust to solidify our knowledge about them and familiarize ourselves with the tools we might need. We then procede by building the neural network and training it on a pre-made snake game.
