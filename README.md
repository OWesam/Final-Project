# Final-Project

Group Name: Project Snake

Group Members: Wesam Oueslati(woues2), Ayush Tarachandani(ayusht3)

Project: 
  We want to build a neural network capable of performing as well as an average player or even better in the game snake. We will be building a neural network and training it on a pre-made game of snake. Our goal is to make this network figure out the best and most efficient way to play the game for the longest time.

Technical overview:
  We plan on spending most of the time learning about neural networks and how to build one. We then plan on looking through example neural networks in rust to solidify our knowledge about them and familiarize ourselves with the tools we might need. We then procede by building the neural network and training it on a pre-made snake game.
  
CheckPoint #1: 
    Watch tutorials
    Get familiar with neural networks
    Set up the game environment
    
CheckPoint #2:
   Build the neural network
   Train the model 
   Implement interaction between neural network and game environment

  Final Deadline: 
    Finishing touches
    Adding extra features
    Debugging


Possible Challenges:
	The Rust language is different from the languages we are used to working with. So, it will be a little challenging to implement a neural network in this language. We also do not have much experience with machine learning and neural networks. Thus, we will need to implement the concept while learning it. 
Since we're used to object-oriented methods, it might also be a bit difficult to get used to the way we design our structs in Rust. Debugging the little errors can get quite painful in machine learning projects and when your code grows in complexity.
